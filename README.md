Personal Internet Data Coin
What is PIDCoin Project?
An open source ecosystem that works under the principles of the blockchain, to return ownership of the data generated on the Internet to all Internet users.

Why PIDcoin?
Because PIDcoin is open source that distributes the billions generated by the use of data fairly among Internet users, not among powerful companies

What is the backing of the real value of this coin?
Money, to be considered such, must have a backup value. That is, something tangible, with a purpose and of common interest.

For centuries, the quintessential money was gold. And it stayed like that until 1971; when Nixon decided that the USA dollar would no longer be backed by gold.

Today, there is a new type of backing value, even more valuable than gold itself. In fact, this produces about 140 Billions in profits each year for companies like Google and Facebook.

How it works?
PIDcoin should have a finite number of coins; that are distributed among all users. Advertisers who wish to advertise in PIDcoin ecosystem, must buy the coins directly from Internet users. The coins will be returned in full to the users who use the ecosystem daily.

We see the PIDcoin ecosystem as a browser, but we really want to know how you imagine it?

This project is just being created and we need all the help possible to structure and and find the way to develop it.
